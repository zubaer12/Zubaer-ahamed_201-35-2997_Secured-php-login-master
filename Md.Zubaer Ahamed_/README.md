PHP login script that includes secure validation, MySQLi injection protection and has great design.
## On HOLD
As my university academic session is starting, I won't be able to update my projects as often as I would like to.

## Who is this script for ?
If you are looking for a simple login script then this is for you. A lot of beginners try to build login scripts from scratch and end up using outdated salting and hashing. This script comes with a fully implemented user validation system covering most of security issues. You should use this login script with the registraton script also available on my [Github] (https://github.com/MartinoEst/php-user-registration).
## Requirements
1. PHP 5.6
2. mySQLi activated

## Live demo

```
You can user these credentials to test the login function:
Username: test
Password: test
```
## Installation
Create a MySQL database named 'membership'.  
Change database server, user, password in config/dbconnect.php.  
Run the script below to create MySQL table.  
```
CREATE TABLE `membership`.`users`(
  `id` INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  `username` VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL,
  `email` VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL,
  `password` VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY(`id`)
) ENGINE = InnoDB;
```
